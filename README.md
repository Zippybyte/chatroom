  Chatroom is a simple, well chatroom website.
  You can create rooms by just imputting a room name and people can connect to the room with the room name.

  The main application, it's made with python, flask, and flask-socketio.

  ###### helpers.py
  Only has the function error which displays the error.html page when an error happens.
